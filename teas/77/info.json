  "description": "Nature’s Way is red tea that is also from the same farm in Pinglin as Nature’s Gate. It is common for many tea farms in the world to use the early, spring flushes of their tea to produce whatever tea the region is famous for (in this case, Baozhong), and then use the later flush(es) to make a red tea that is sold for cheaper. This red tea is the late spring flush from the same ecological trees that were harvested to make Nature’s Gate. This striped red tea is made from mature leaves grown in a rich, ecologically diverse terroir. The tea itself is therefore complex and rich, full of minerals and life. This richness expresses itself more and more as the session goes on. In the early steepings, it is fruity and sweet with a simplicity that we adore. This then fades into a minerally “cliff flavor (岩味)” that lingers in the mouth. The energy is bold and Yang, uplifting and bright in some of the ways Nature’s Gate shines. It is more earthy, though, with greater depth. Though it seems more Yang than its sister, it is in fact more grounded.",
