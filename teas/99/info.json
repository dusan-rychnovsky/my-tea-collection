  "description": "Shortcut is a shou puerh blended with Maitake mushrooms. It is called \"shortcut\" in reference to the chapter from the greatest book (LOTR) called \"Shortcut to Mushrooms.\" It is a blend of Elixir, a deep, rich and earthy aged shou puerh from the 1980s. Elixir is already bold and tastes of mushrooms and autumn forests, making it the perfect candidate to blend with dried mushrooms. Elixir is rooted, grounding and peaceful. It is also open and often used as the water or earth element in a Five Element blend. Maitake mushrooms provide various vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds such as beta-glucans, which have been associated with potential health benefits in both traditional medicine and scientific research. Current evidence indicates possible advantages including immune system support, blood sugar regulation and cardiovascular health. They are a superfood and often included in mushroom blends to promote health and well-being. The combination is delicious and nutritious. We find it great in a mug before and during our day.",
