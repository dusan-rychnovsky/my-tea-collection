  "description": "Three Grains is a genmaicha, or toasted grain green tea made in Taiwan. We call it “three grains,” even though only two were used (buckwheat and red quinoa), because the third grain is friendship. This tea was made by a farmer’s association in Taiwan of organic farmers helping one another out by purchasing tea and grain from one another to support their mutual goal of regenerative agriculture. If you like toasted grain genmaicha, you will love this tea. It is toasty, warm and rich. It is filling and grounding and goes well with a meal.",
