  "name": "2025 Mengsong Shou Puerh",
  "description": "Threshold is a rich, dark and vibrant 2025 shou from Mengsong in Menghai County. It has a classic, Menghai shou character, with dark chocolately bitterness that has hints of berries and a slightly sweet aftertaste. Mengsong tea is famous for its bitter-sweet qualities, which some say tastes a bit like licorice when it is made into shou. The Qi of this tea is strong for a shou, but still deep and grounding. Threshold is great for drinking or aging.",
