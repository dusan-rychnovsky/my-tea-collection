  "description": "Nature’s Gate is a glorious Baozhong tea that was just harvested in spring 2025. This tea is from an ecological tea garden in Pinglin, Taiwan (the same as Nature’s Way). The tea produced there is more than organic; it is healthy, natural, biodiverse and regenerative. “Baozhong” refers to the paper wrapping that this traditional, striped oolong (referring to the shape of the leaves) was once wrapped in. In those days, it was more oxidized and roasted, so it could be packaged in this way. Baozhong was, in fact, the first tea in Taiwan to have a lightly-oxidized version like Nature’s Gate, producing light, striped tea in the late Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). Nowadays, almost all Baozhong is lightly-oxidized and is often amongst the lightest oolong in the world. Nature’s Gate is light and bright, open and Yang. It is purifying, cleansing the palate and uplifting the spirit. It is cooling and refreshing, which is perfect for the hot weather that most of us are harmonizing with.",
