  "description": "Ripe sheng puer tea from the Menghai area (勐海), which was pressed in the winter of 2008. The tea leaves are a mix of tea leaves with the prevalence of old/mature tea trees (dashu 大树 and qiaomu 乔木) and were processed by Hengyi (恒益) tea factory. Tea comes from Shanshan's friend Yuguang, who belongs to the Dai ethnic group (傣族). Her family worked in various tea factories, which is why you can taste part of the tea production from the famous and non-existent Menghai Tea Factory (Menghai Chachang 勐海茶厂) since 2004. The tea is sold in the form of a pressed brick (chazhuan 茶砖) weighing approximately 250 g (± 10%), which is suitable for long-term storage.",
