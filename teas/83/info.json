  "name": "Charcoal-Roasted Oolong Tea",
  "description": "Heavenly Turn is a beautiful charcoal-roasted, traditionally-processed oolong from Central Taiwan. Traditionally, oolong tea was oxidized between forty and seventy percent. Nowadays, a lot of oolong tea in Taiwan and elsewhere is lighter. They say that each stage of the tea processing should enhance the tea without leaving a trace of itself, so the roasting should not leave a roasty flavor in other words. This tea is roasted superbly, with a strong and bright aftertaste that lingers in the mouth for many minutes after you swallow. Heavenly Turn is uplifting, gentle and bright. It is flavorful, rich and opening. It nourishes the digestion and leaves you energized and satisfied. There are deep aromas that go on, luring you deeper into your cup after it is emptied and seeming to lead down a trail well beyond where your nose can travel.",
