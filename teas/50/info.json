  "description": "A hidden gem from Darjeeling - the first-ever Rock Oolong tea from this renowned region. Sourced from the high-elevation Mirik Valley, this tea is crafted using Taiwanese techniques, resulting in a unique and delightful tea experience. This aromatic tea is made from large premium leaves and boasts sweet floral and nutty notes, producing a bright orange liquor that beckons you to take your first sip. The smooth, pleasant cup begins with floral tones reminiscent of orchid blossoms, setting a delicate and inviting foundation. A subtle fruity hint of peach adds a gentle sweetness around the edge, while toasted nutty flavours deepen the palate mi-sip. As you savour the tea, the blend of flavours blossoms in your mouth, encouraging further exploration. Towards the end, toasted cedar notes impart a light smoky-woody character, gracefully fading to leave a lingering, satisfying finish.",
