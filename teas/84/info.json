  "description": "Transcendence is a tea that has been years in the making and one of the best Taiwanese oolong teas we have ever tried. Master Lu Li Zhen held a long-standing dream to make a traditional Tieguanyin, but could not find suitable raw material. He worked to plant tieguanyin varietals in Alishan and waited for the trees to grow to a suitable age for processing. Master Lu is an expert at roasting and has been doing so for decades. He roasted this tea over five days. Transcendence offers an exquisite liquor that is complex, balanced, open and deep. It projects a bouquet of flavors and a Qi that is uplifting and extends beyond the body. This is an excellent tea for drinking and also perfect for aging.",
