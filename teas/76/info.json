  "description": "Lotus Throne is a glorious “maocha” or “unfinished tea,” from old-arbor trees growing in Wuliang Mountain. It is grown at around 2,300 meters above sea level, making it some the highest altitude puerh in Yunnan, just south of the clouds. These tea gardens are considered to be among the most remote in all of Yunnan. The lack of roads and steep drive has helped preserved the environment in the area. They say that the tea from this region has an orchid fragrance. It is floral, open and graceful. The astringency transforms quickly, leaving behind a syrup of sweetness that coats the mouth and throat. This tea is marvelous when prepared leaves in a bowl. The energy is an open, clear Yang energy that is very invigorating at this time of year.",
